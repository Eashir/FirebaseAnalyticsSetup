Initial Firebase Package Setup

I'll be going off the sources listed at the bottom of the page. I'm starting with the first link I posted.

Make sure to install the correct Firebase Analytics package with the Swift Package Manager. According to the official Firebase setup guide, you have to install the package named Firebase Analytics, not FirebaseAnalyticsSwift, as the latter is an extension of the main package.

Remove the Firebase package https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56718121/how-to-delete-swift-package-dependency-in-xcode-11

Reinstall and be sure to check the right box.
